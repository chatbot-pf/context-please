# Problem 1-Pager: Phase 3 - Verification

**Epic**: Issue #14 - Replace console.log with MCP-compliant Pino logging system
**Phase**: 3 of 3
**Duration**: 2-3 days
**Size**: 1 small PR (~50 LOC + 100 tests)
**Blocked By**: Phase 2 (Migration)

---

## Context

Phase 2 has successfully replaced all 400+ console.* calls with structured Pino logging throughout the codebase. Now Phase 3 verifies the migration is complete, removes the stderr redirect workaround (now redundant), and confirms full MCP protocol compliance.

**Current State**:
- ✅ Pino logger infrastructure active
- ✅ 400+ console.* calls → Pino logging (Phase 2 complete)
- ✅ Structured metadata on all logs
- ✅ Log sampling for high-volume operations
- ❌ Stderr redirect workaround still present (now redundant)
- ❌ MCP compliance not yet formally verified

**Target State**:
- ✅ 0 console.* calls verified by grep
- ✅ Stderr redirect workaround removed
- ✅ Full MCP protocol compliance verified
- ✅ Performance benchmarks documented
- ✅ Issue #14 resolved and closed

---

## Problem

**What remains?**
- Stderr redirect workaround (lines 22-31 in `packages/mcp/src/index.ts`) is now dead code
- No formal verification that MCP protocol is fully compliant
- Performance impact of Pino logging not benchmarked
- Issue #14 not yet closed/resolved

**Why complete Phase 3?**
- Clean up technical debt (remove workaround)
- Formally verify MCP compliance for production deployment
- Ensure performance meets <5% overhead target
- Document completion and learnings

**What's the risk of not doing Phase 3?**
- Dead code remains in codebase (technical debt)
- Unknown if MCP clients work correctly
- Performance regression not detected
- Issue #14 remains open indefinitely

---

## Goal

**Complete logging migration and verify MCP compliance:**

1. Remove stderr redirect workaround (now redundant)
2. Formally verify zero console.* calls in production
3. Integration test with real MCP client (Claude Code CLI)
4. Benchmark performance (verify <5% overhead)
5. Document completion and close issue #14

**Success = Production-ready Pino logging system with MCP compliance verified**

---

## Non-Goals

- ❌ Add new logging features
- ❌ Refactor existing logging code (completed in Phase 2)
- ❌ Major performance optimizations (benchmarking only)
- ❌ Change MCP API or capabilities

---

## Constraints

1. **Zero console.* in production**: Verified by grep and code review
2. **No breaking changes**: Keep existing API unchanged
3. **MCP protocol compliance**: Follow spec exactly
4. **Performance target**: <5% overhead with sampling
5. **Documentation complete**: All reference docs updated

---

## Solution Summary

### Task 1: Remove Stderr Redirect Workaround

**File**: `packages/mcp/src/index.ts`

**Before** (lines 1-32):
```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env node

// CRITICAL: Redirect console outputs to stderr IMMEDIATELY...
// Only MCP protocol messages should go to stdout

import { Server } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js'

const originalConsoleLog = console.log
const originalConsoleWarn = console.warn

console.log = (...args: any[]) => {
  process.stderr.write(`[LOG] ${args.join(' ')}\n`)
}

console.warn = (...args: any[]) => {
  process.stderr.write(`[WARN] ${args.join(' ')}\n`)
}

// ... rest of code ...
```

**After** (lines 1-10):
```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env node

// All logging is now handled by Pino logger
// Pino outputs to stderr by default (MCP-compliant)
// See docs/develop/LOGGING.md for logging guidelines

import { Server } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js'

// ... rest of code (unchanged) ...
```

**Changes**:
- Remove lines 3-31 (workaround block)
- Update comment at top to explain Pino usage
- Verify tests still pass

### Task 2: Verify Zero Console.* Calls

**Verification Command**:
```bash
# Should return 0 matches
grep -r "console\." packages/core/src packages/mcp/src --include="*.ts"
```

**Expected Output**:
```
# No matches (exit code 0)
```

**Edge Cases**:
- Ensure we're only checking `.ts` files (not `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts`)
- Verify grep doesn't find commented-out code
- Check for console in string literals (should be rare)

**Evidence**:
- [ ] Grep command run and documented
- [ ] Screenshot/log showing 0 matches
- [ ] Cross-checked 5 key files manually

### Task 3: Integration Test with MCP Client

**Test File**: `packages/mcp/test/integration/mcp-protocol-compliance.integration.test.ts` (NEW)

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest'
import { setLogLevel, createLogger } from '@pleaseai/context-please-core'

describe('MCP Protocol Compliance', () => {
  it('should accept logging/setLevel requests', () => {
    const levels = ['debug', 'info', 'warn', 'error']
    for (const level of levels) {
      expect(() => setLogLevel(level)).not.toThrow()
    }
  })

  it('should produce structured JSON logs', () => {
    const logger = createLogger('ComplianceTest')
    const bindings = logger.bindings() as any
    expect(bindings.component).toBe('ComplianceTest')
  })

  it('should output to stderr only', () => {
    const logger = createLogger('StderrTest')
    // Note: Actual stdout capture would require
    // wrapping process.stdout/stderr
    expect(() => {
      logger.info({}, 'Test message')
    }).not.toThrow()
  })
})
```

**Manual Testing** (optional but recommended):
```bash
# Start MCP server
cd packages/mcp
LOG_LEVEL=debug node dist/index.ts &

# In another terminal, test with curl
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/logging/setLevel \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"level": "debug"}'

# Should see response: {}
```

### Task 4: Performance Benchmarking

**Benchmark File**: `scripts/benchmark-logging.js` (NEW)

```javascript
/**
 * Benchmark logging performance overhead
 * Compare indexing speed with/without Pino logging
 */
const { Context } = require('@pleaseai/context-please-core')
const fs = require('fs')
const path = require('path')

async function runBenchmark() {
  const testDir = '/tmp/test-codebase'

  // Create test codebase (1000 files)
  console.log('Creating test codebase...')
  createTestCodebase(testDir, 1000)

  // Benchmark indexing
  console.log('Benchmarking indexing performance...')
  const startTime = Date.now()

  const context = new Context()
  await context.indexCodebase(testDir, (progress) => {
    if (progress.current % 100 === 0) {
      console.log(`Progress: ${progress.current}/${progress.total}`)
    }
  })

  const duration = Date.now() - startTime
  const overhead = duration / 1000 // Convert to seconds

  console.log(`\n=== Benchmark Results ===`)
  console.log(`Files indexed: 1000`)
  console.log(`Duration: ${overhead}s`)
  console.log(`Overhead per file: ${(overhead / 1000).toFixed(2)}ms`)

  // Target: <5% overhead = <50ms per file
  if (overhead > 50) {
    throw new Error(`Overhead ${overhead}ms exceeds target 50ms`)
  }

  console.log('✅ Performance target met!')
}

function createTestCodebase(dir, count) {
  if (!fs.existsSync(dir)) fs.mkdirSync(dir, { recursive: true })

  for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    const file = path.join(dir, `file-${i}.ts`)
    const content = `
// Test file ${i}
export function test${i}() {
  console.log('Test ${i}')
  return ${i}
}
    `
    fs.writeFileSync(file, content)
  }
}

runBenchmark().catch(e => {
  console.error('Benchmark failed:', e)
  process.exit(1)
})
```

**Benchmark Goals**:
- Indexing 1000 files should take ~10-15 seconds (with log sampling)
- Per-file overhead: <15ms
- Target: <5% overhead vs baseline

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ <15ms per file
- ✅ <5% overhead with log sampling
- ✅ No memory leaks during long operations

### Task 5: Documentation Updates

#### Update `docs/develop/LOGGING.md`
- Add section: "MCP Protocol Compliance"
- Include `logging/setLevel` example
- Document performance characteristics
- Link to Pino best practices

#### Update `docs/README.md`
- Add link to LOGGING.md
- Update logging section status (Complete ✅)
- Reference issue #14 resolution

#### Update `CLAUDE.md`
- Remove any references to stderr redirect workaround
- Confirm logging standards (already updated in Phase 1)
- Add performance notes

#### Create `docs/plans/logging-implementation-summary.md` (NEW)
```markdown
